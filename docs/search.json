    "text": "Introduction\nIt’s been a few weeks that I have started taking the fantastic deep learning course, fastai, by Jeremy Howard and it has been an amazing learning journey so far. I come from a STEM background but Howard’s style of teaching deep learning has brought a fresh perspective into learning this field. As I go through each lecture, I made the decision of documenting and sharing my experiences and learning outcomes publicly, so that it could inspire, help or encourage someone along the same path. This course has been a game-changer in my learning path so far, and I’m thrilled to talk about my first project in image classification.\nIn this very first blog, I will guide you through deploying an image classification model using HuggingFace and Gradio. This method is beginner-friendly, straightforward and completely free. Whether you are a newcomer or looking to refine your deployment skills, I’ll walk you through each step, ensuring that by the end, you’ll be able to deploy your own models effortlessly. So, let’s get started on the exciting journey!"
