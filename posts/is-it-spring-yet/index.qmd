This is a post with executable code.

When I first started learning about image classification back in 2018 I was amazed by how a computer system can recognize objects. One of the first projects I worked on was to classify multiple different objects, and since I was living in the Canada, I came up with the idea of categorizing Canadian seasons, aka: spring, winter and construction.

Everything I used for this project is completely free and everyone can implement it within a few minutes!

The basic steps we'll take are:

1.  Use DuckDuckGo to search for images of "bird photos"
2.  Use DuckDuckGo to search for images of "forest photos"
3.  Fine-tune a pretrained neural network to recognise these two groups
4.  Try running this model on a picture of a bird and see if it works.
