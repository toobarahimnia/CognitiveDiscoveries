One of the first projects I worked on was to classify multiple different objects, and since I was living in the Canada, I came up with the idea of categorizing Canadian seasons, aka: spring, winter and construction.\n\nEverything I used for this project is completely free and everyone can implement it within a few minutes!\n\nThe basic steps we'll take are:\n\n1.  Use DuckDuckGo to search for images of \"bird photos\"\n2.  Use DuckDuckGo to search for images of \"forest photos\"\n3.  Fine-tune a pretrained neural network to recognise these two groups\n4.  Try running this model on a picture of a bird and see if it works.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.1 .cell-code}\n\n```\n:::\n\n'''{r}\n\n'''\n",
